I love coffee, I love every kind of coffee,
I just wanna drink all of them, but I can't,
Can't drink every coffee,
Can't drink every coffee.
I'm thinking about coffee again, and again, and again, and again, and again,
I think about how productive I feel when drinking one,
and how, I should have them...
I think about how good they taste,
and how many different kinds there are.
I just love them, and I want them,
and I want a latte, and I want an americano
I just love it, and I always want one in my hands all the time. 
Sorry, I'm getting emotional.
I love coffee, I really love every sort of coffee,
I just wanna drink all of them, but I can't,
Can't drink every coffee,
Can't drink every coffee.
So anyway, I am a coffee lover,
but I know I canâ€™t have too much. 
Would be bad for my health. 
I'm sorry, I'm thinking about coffee again,
I really love all coffee,
but I can't drink every coffee,
Can't drink every coffee.
Can't drink every coffee.
