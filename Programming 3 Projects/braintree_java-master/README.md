# Braintree Java library

The Braintree Java library provides integration access to the Braintree Gateway.

## Please Note
> **The Payment Card Industry (PCI) Council has [mandated](https://blog.pcisecuritystandards.org/migrating-from-ssl-and-early-tls) that early versions of TLS be retired from service.  All organizations that handle credit card information are required to comply with this standard. As part of this obligation, Braintree is updating its services to require TLS 1.2 for all HTTPS connections. Braintree will also require HTTP/1.1 for all connections. Please see our [technical documentation](https://github.com/paypal/tls-update) for more information.**

## Quick Start Example

````java
import java.math.BigDecimal;
import com.braintreegateway.*;

public class BraintreeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BraintreeGateway gateway = new BraintreeGateway(
            Environment.SANDBOX,
            "the_merchant_id",
            "the_public_key",
            "the_private_key"
        );

        TransactionRequest request = new TransactionRequest()
            .amount(new BigDecimal("1000.00")
            .paymentMethodNonce(nonceFromTheClient)
            .options()
                .submitForSettlement(true)
                .done();

        Result<Transaction> result = gateway.transaction().sale(request);

        if (result.isSuccess()) {
            Transaction transaction = result.getTarget();
            System.out.println("Success!: " + transaction.getId());
        } else if (result.getTransaction() != null) {
            Transaction transaction = result.getTransaction();
            System.out.println("Error processing transaction:");
            System.out.println("  Status: " + transaction.getStatus());
            System.out.println("  Code: " + transaction.getProcessorResponseCode());
            System.out.println("  Text: " + transaction.getProcessorResponseText());
        } else {
            for (ValidationError error : result.getErrors().getAllDeepValidationErrors()) {
               System.out.println("Attribute: " + error.getAttribute());
               System.out.println("  Code: " + error.getCode());
               System.out.println("  Message: " + error.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }
}

## Documentation

 * [Official documentation](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/java/sdk/server/overview)

## Maven

  With Maven installed, this package can be built simply by running this command:

     mvn package

  The resulting jar file will be produced in the directory named "target".

### In repositories:

     Maven Central, which should be enabled by default. No additional repositories are required.

### In dependencies

    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.braintreepayments.gateway</groupId>
      <artifactId>braintree-java</artifactId>
      <version>PUT VERSION NUMBER HERE</version>
    </dependency>

## Developer (Docker)

The `Makefile` and `Dockerfile` will build an image containing the dependencies and drop you to a terminal where you can run tests.

```
make
```

## Tests
The unit specs can be run by anyone on any system, but the integration specs are meant to be run against a local development server of our gateway code. These integration specs are not meant for public consumption and will likely fail if run on your system. To run unit tests use rake(`rake test:unit`) or Maven(`mvn verify -DskipITs`).
