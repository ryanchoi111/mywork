### Why DJ 183?
Everyone in our final project group found DJ-183 to be incredibly interesting and fun to create.
Additionally, along with practicing Python, we all wanted to get some experience with website
development. Having done C++ throughout the majority of the semester, we wanted to take a leap and experiment with Python and CSS. We think that we can make our DJ-183 project very creative by not only uniquely
designing the website, but also having our reach involve more user-interaction.

### Previous Web Experience
Two of the team members in our group has prior web experience. One of those team members also has experience with Python. The remainder of the group has not had prior web or Python experience.

### Overall Project Description

DJ-183 is an interactive music quiz for users to test how well they know their music. The user can pick the genre he/she wants from a list of choices and then will receive a preview of a song in that genre. It will be the user's job to figure out and select which song is playing from a list of four songs. If the user gets it right, their score will go up. If not, the score will not change. If they get bored of the genre, they can choose another genre and continue playing. If they want to restart the game, they can clear their score and start from the beginning.
For our reach, we included a leaderboard so that users can compare their scores with one another to see who obtained the highest score in one quiz. Given that users can choose to upload their scores to the leaderboard whenever they would like in a given quiz, the leaderboard ranks the users' scores by the number of their correct answers. The board ONLY displays the top ten scores (there will already be a couple of scores on the leaderboard for other users to try to beat). Once you create a username to upload your score, if you re-submit the same username to upload another higher score, the previous score will update itself. Additionally, along with the correct song popping up after the user submitted their guess in, we also included a Youtube video of the correct song that users can watch and listen to. Lastly, we  made the website more eye-appealing and captivating, drawing users to want to interact with the game more. The theme of our website is "pink and purple retro".

### Group Logistics
Our group meets 3-4 times a week at Ross study rooms or at South Quad for 2-3 hour sessions. We have a group chat on text to figure out the logistics/plans. As for the work, we divided the work so that half of the group works on the backend portion while the other half works on the frontend portion. However, we constantly communicated with each other, asking for help whenever we needed it regardless if it was the frontend or backend portion of the project. After each session, we decided what we would work on individually before we met up for the next session. As we worked individually, we were still active on the group chat, asking each other questions and discussing the new bugs we found in our project.
